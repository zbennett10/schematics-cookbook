# The Action

Actions are atomic operations that are created by schematics. They are applied and committed to a Tree.

Angular Schematics comes with the following, self-explanatory Actions. All of these Actions implement the base class  - Action.

`CreateFileAction`

`DeleteFileAction`

`OverwriteFileAction`

`RenameFileAction`

# The Sink

Sinks are responsible for validating and committing Actions.

The Schematics library provides three separate Sinks for use. Each of these Sinks are implementations of the abstract base class SimpleSinkBase which provides a number of different methods which help customize the validation and committal of Actions in your schematic. These sinks include:

`HostSink`

This sink

`FileSystemSink`

This sink

`DryRunSink`
