# Introduction to Schematics

Angular Schematics, simply put, is a scaffolding tool for developers - much like Yeoman. It provides a sleek, functional interface through which developers can transform and customize a filesystem. However, Angular Schematics contains zero side effects by safely abstracting away any changes to the filesystem. By using abstractactions such as `Trees` and `Sinks`, the library safely waits to commit file transactions to the host until fully ready.  Throughout your reading of this book, you will gain key insights regarding Schematics which will allow you to solve developer problems of varying types more efficiently.

If you are an Angular developer, odds are that you've used Schematics before - albeit indirectly. Angular CLI commands such as `ng new` and `ng generate component` use Schematics under the hood. It's become almost common knowledge that you can create your own custom schematics that alter Angular's CLI commands. But did you know that you can use Schematics to scaffold out a new Scala project or to install the Node dependencies of a project using either NPM or Yarn?

Schematics is a new and exciting tool being developed by the Angular team. However, this scaffolding library is not tied down to Node and Angular alone. This book seeks to illuminate its full potential by breaking down some of the key types from Schematics' source code and by giving the reader insight through practical schematic *recipes*.
