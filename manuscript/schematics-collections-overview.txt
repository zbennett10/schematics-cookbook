# Schematics Collections

There are no tricks here - the title is self-explanatory. Schematics Collections, simply put, are collections of schematics.

A schematics collection is the means through which Angular's Schematics CLI references individual schematics.

An example use of the Schematics CLI:

`schematics collection_name:schematics_name --args --go --here`

As you can see here, the Schematics CLI is used by passing in a schematics collection name followed by an individual schematic name (or alias as we will see later on). Any additional arguments will be passed into the schematic itself.

A schematic collection's structure might look like the following:

```bash
/my-schematics-collection
    /src
        /schematic-one
        /schematic-two
    collection.json
    package.json
```

As you can see, the structure is quite simple. First we have our `/src` directory which contains our individual schematic directories. It is in these directories that we will keep our schematic code and templating files (more on this later). 

Next, there is the *`collection.json`* file. This file will contain metadata which will be used to describe the schematics which are found inside of our schematics collection.

Lastly, we find the standard *`package.json`* through which we can pull down any Node dependencies our project requires and perform various other administrative tasks that are beyond the scope of this book. Please see [NPM's documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json)<sup>1</sup> regarding the *`package.json`*.
