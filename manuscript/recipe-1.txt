# Recipe 1 - Altering `ng generate component`

In this recipe, we will create a schematic that customizes Angular CLI's `ng generate component` command. Under the hood, Angular CLI's `ng generate component` command uses a Angular schematic named `component`. To view this schematic's source code, visit [here](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/tree/master/packages/schematics/angular/component).

To complete this recipe, you will need to have the Angular CLI installed on your host machine. To install Angular CLI globally on your machine, run the following command:

`npm install -g @angular/cli`

---

## Preparation

First, we will create a new Angular project that will use the schematic we will soon create.

In order to create a new Angular application, we need to run the following command:

`ng new test-app`

You now have a new, baseline Angular application available in the `test-app` directory.
