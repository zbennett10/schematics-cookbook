# Recipe 1 - Altering `ng generate component`

In this recipe, we will create a schematic that customizes Angular CLI's `ng generate component` command. Under the hood, Angular CLI's `ng generate component` command uses a Angular schematic named `component`. To view this schematic's source code, visit [here](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/tree/master/packages/schematics/angular/component).

To complete this recipe, you will need to have the Angular CLI installed on your host machine. To install Angular CLI globally on your machine, run the following command:

`npm install -g @angular/cli`

## Preparation

### Our Test Angular Application

First, we will create a new Angular project that will use the schematic we will soon create.

In order to create a new Angular application, we need to run the following command:

`ng new test-app`

You now have a new, baseline Angular application available in the `test-app` directory.

### Our Schematic Collection

Next, we are going to create the schematic collection that will house each one of our recipes. We will call it the `cookbook`.

In the same directory that houses our '`test-app`' Angular application, run the following command:

`schematics blank --name=cookbook`

That command scaffolded the Angular schematic collection which we will use to house all of our 'recipe' schematics.

### Creating Our First Recipe

First things first, we need to change the name of the `cookbook` schematic which was auto-generated inside of our `cookbook` schematic collection when we first created it. 

First off, we need to change this default schematic's metadata located inside of `cookbook/src/collection.json`.

We are going to change this schematic's name from `cookbook` to `cookbook-component`. Here is an example of what our collection.json will look like after these alterations:

```json
    {
        "$schema": "../node_modules/@angular-devkit/schematics/collection-schema.json",
        "schematics": {
            "cookbook-component": {
            "description": "Generates a cookbook Angular component",
            "factory": "./cookbook-component/index#cookbookComponent"
            }
        }
    }
```
