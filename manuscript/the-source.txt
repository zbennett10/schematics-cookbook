# The Source

Angular describes a `Source` as a "function that creates an entirely new `Tree` from an empty filesystem"[^1].

A `Source`'s single purpose is to return a `Tree`. `Sources` work in conjunction with `Rules` in order to create and transform `Trees`. The Schematics library provides the following `Source` factories which help creators of schematics with most, basic operations. These factories include:

---

`source(tree: Tree): Source`

This factory returns a `Source` that itself returns the input `Tree`.

---

`empty(): Source`

This factory returns a Source that returns an empty Tree.

---

`apply(source: Source, rules: Rule[]): Source`

This function applies a list of `Rules` to a `Source` and returns a new `Source`.

---

`url(url: string): Source`

This function returns a `Source` that returns a `Tree` with files loaded from the give URL.

---

## Other Helpers

`asSource(rule: Rule): Source`

This function transforms the given `Rule` into a `Source`.
