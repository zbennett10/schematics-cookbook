# The Source

Angular describes a Source as a "function that creates an entirely new Tree from an empty filesystem".
FOOTNOTE - https://github.com/angular/angular-devkit-schematics-builds

A Source's single purpose is to return a Tree. Source's work in conjunction with Rules in order to create and transform Trees. The Schematics library provides the following Source factories which help creators of schematics with most, basic operations. These factories include:

--- 

`source(tree: Tree): Source`

Returns a Source that returns the Tree passed in as its solitary value

---

`empty(): Source`

Returns a Source that returns an empty Tree

---

`apply(source: Source, rules: Rule[]): Source`

Applies a list of Rules to a Source and returns a Source that returns the resulting Tree

---

`url(url: string): Source`

Returns a Source that returns a Tree with files loaded from a URL as a CreateAction 

---
## Other Helpers

`asSource(rule: Rule): Source`

Transforms the given Rule into a Source and returns it
